# calc

Basic calculator that has the ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide.

The calculator does not allow you to divide by 0 (zero). Doing so will give a snarky message.

Note that this calculator does not follow order of operations. 

Instead the results are calculated in sequence. 

12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = yields 42  NOT  12+7-(15) = 4


More functionality and an upgraded design will follow once I continue with TOP to avoid spending too much time on the calculator.
